We've just had our first day of the new doctoral training programme in Data-Driven Engineering and Sciences. Welcome to Abhishek, Alex, Jason, and Jens! (Hopefully a couple more people to join slightly later.)

We had a great day co-designing the training programme with the students, and getting to know each other. Looking forward to the rest of the year!
