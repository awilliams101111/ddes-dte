Hi, I'm Jason, I graduated with an MEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Bristol, where I specialised in quantum photonics and telecommunications. My Masters' research focussed on exploring and simulating distributed Bragg reflectors with cavities, and investigating how apodisation (tapering) effects their behaviour. My research interests are on the applications of machine learning in the world of electromagnetism, and applying machine learning to quantum hardware. My general interests range from (and not limited to) gaming, electronics tinkering and an avid metalhead! I hope to strengthen my grounding in mathematical modelling with data-driven methods while developing the skills to solve challenging PDE-based problems in electromagnetics and quantum technologies. Iâ€™m also looking forward to growing as a scientific communicator and working closely with my cohort to build new interdisciplinary perspectives.
