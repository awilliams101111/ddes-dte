Hi, I'm Jason, I graduated with an MEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Bristol, where I specialised in quantum photonics and telecommunications. My Masters' research focussed on exploring and simulating distributed Bragg reflectors with cavities, and investigating how apodisation (tapering) effects their behaviour.
