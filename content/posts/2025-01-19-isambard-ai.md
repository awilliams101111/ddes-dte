Isambard-AI is set to become the UK’s fastest and most powerful supercomputer, purpose-built for AI research following build completion in Summer 2025. Designed to provide open-source intelligence, it will transform research and drive AI-led breakthroughs in critical areas like automated drug discovery and climate research. There is also significant potential to recycle its heat output for nearby infrastructure.

Built in a climate-controlled modular data centre and backed by cutting-edge Hewlett Packard Enterprise and NVIDIA technology, phase one of Isambard-AI is already up and running, and despite only representing a small part of the overall machine, is currently the second greenest supercomputer in the world and the 128th most powerful.

Recently, Prof Simon McIntosh-Smith spoke with the BBC about some of the potential projects that Isambard-AI could be used for — see this [BBC News article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy5kley15pyo) for more details.
