Are you interested in applying cutting-edge data-driven methodologies to a wide range of interdisciplinary fields? We are offering six fully funded PhD studentships, providing a stipend of approximately £26,000–£28,000 (net) annually. Potential PhD topics span all the research areas in the [School of Engineering Mathematics and Technology](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/science-engineering/schools/eng-maths-tech/#research) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/). These studentships include a year of collaborative team-based training and leadership development. In return, successful candidates will contribute to supporting our Data Science MSc students; therefore, an enthusiasm for teaching is essential.

At the University of Bristol, we strive to build a culture of inclusion and empathy where people can be themselves at work, recognising the value that diversity of people, perspective and experience bring to our ability to innovate and to maintain our position as a leading research-intensive university.
